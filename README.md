# Detect AI-Generated Text Competition

## Problem Statement

The problem statement for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/overview/description).

## Dataset

The original dataset is available on Kaggle: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data).


### Extended Dataset

To address the imbalance issue in the original dataset, additional AI-generated essays were added. The extended dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-proper-train-dataset).

After identifying the imbalance, an undersampling technique was applied, resulting in a balanced dataset with 44,087 samples for each label '1' and '0'.
